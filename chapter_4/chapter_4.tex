% The primary form of fMRI measures the oxygen change in blood flow. This is known as the Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrast. Other increasingly popular functional MRI method is arterial spin labeling (ASL)~\citep{detre1994tissue, alsop1998multisection, williams1992magnetic}, which uses arterial water as tracer to measure cerebral blood flow. Compared to fMRI, ASL has a lower signal to noise ratio~\citep{detre2002technical}. However, ASL provides reliable absolute quantification of cerebral blood flow with higher spatial and temporal resolution than other techniques~\citep{borogovac2012arterial}. This thesis specifically considers BOLD functional MRI and through the manuscript we use the name functional MRI (fMRI) to denote functional MRI based on the BOLD signal.

% \newglossaryentry{bold}{name=BOLD,description={{fMRI contrast that measures oxygen change in blood flow}}}

% %
% The \emph{\gls{bold}} contrast can be explained by considering a protein present in
% the blood
% cells, called hemoglobin. Hemoglobin can bind with oxygen in order to bring it
% into the different cells of the organism, this link being reversible and
% unstable. Thus, it can be found in two different forms: \emph{oxyhemoglobin}
% ($Hb-O_{2}$ - giving a bright red color to the blood), its oxygenated form, and
% \emph{deoxyhemoglobin} ($Hb$ - giving a blue-purple color to the blood), its
% deoxygenated form.
% %
% %
% %
% %
% When the \emph{oxyhemoglobin} loses its oxygen atoms and
% becomes the \emph{deoxyhemoglobin}, it becomes more affected by an externally applied magnetic field (due to the iron
% oxides). The presence of
% \emph{deoxyhemoglobin} in the blood modifies the
% magnetic resonance signal of the protons of the water molecules surrounding the blood
% vessels.

% The difference of magnetic
% susceptibility between the
% blood vessel and the surrounding tissues creates 
% inhomogeneities in the magnetic field \citep{thulborn1982,ogawa1990a} that are quantified by the magnetic resonance scanner. In the seminal paper \citep{ogawa1990b} studied the variations of
% \emph{BOLD} contrast in the brain of an anesthetized rat during the inhalation of a gas
%  that increases the \emph{cerebral blood flow} (\emph{CBF}), and thus blood
% oxygenation (see Figure
% \ref{fig:chapter_1_ogawa}).

% The spatial resolution is given by the size of a \emph{\gls{voxel}}, a three-dimensional rectangular cuboid given by a single measure of the scanner. Voxel sizes range from 4mm to 1mm. Smaller voxels contain fewer neurons on average, incorporate less blood flow and hence have less signal to noise ratio than larger voxels. Smaller voxel size also makes up for longer acquisition time since this is proportional to the number of voxels per slice and the number of slices to scan. 

% The time resolution of an fMRI scanner is given by the repetition time (\gls{TR}) of successive image acquisitions. A slice of the volume acquisition has an acquisition window that is about 20-30ms in duration. For example, in the study~\citep{borghesani:hal-00986606} we used voxel sizes of $1.5 \times 1.5 \times 1.5$mm, 82 slices and a repetition time (TR) of 2.3 seconds for a full-brain coverage. These number are for routine fMRI, however it is possible to change the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution. With the advent of compressed sensing techniques for faster acquisition times~\citep{MRM:MRM21391, Zong2014312, chauffertvariable} and the deployment of scanners with fields of 7-Tesla and beyond~\citep{hanke2014high} these numbers are likely to change in the near future.

% % The dynamics, location, and magnitude of the signal are highly influenced by the vasculature as it is sampled in each voxel. If a voxel happen to capture large vessel effects, the magnitude of the signal may be larger, the timing a bit more delayed than average (up to 4 s delayed from capillary effects)~\citep{bandettini2009functional}

Tavor et al., Cole et al.,
\section{Proposed techniques}

% In this section we present a model that allows to extract time-independent \gls{activation coefficient}s relative to a given task given the BOLD time course and an experimental design. This model is known as the \emph{general linear model}~\citep{Friston1995}. We start by describing the \emph{hemodynamic response function} (Section~\ref{subsec:hrf}) and then describe an assumption behind the general linear model, the linear-time-invariant property (Section~\ref{subsec:lti}) between the BOLD signal and the neural response. The general linear model is then presented in Section~\ref{chapter_1_GLM}.


% % fMRI acquisitions consist of successive brain scans, given in intervals ranging from 1 to 4 seconds. However, the methods that we consider in this thesis take as input time-independent \gls{activation coefficient}s relative to a given task. In this section we describe a method that allows to estimate time-independent \gls{activation coefficient} given the BOLD time course

% % . 


% The concepts presented in this section will form the basis of the contribution presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:hrf_estimation}, where we present an extension of the general linear model that performs the joint estimation of HRF and activation coefficients. 

% Because it will not be referenced in later chapters we do not mention several \emph{preprocessing} steps that can be applied to the BOLD signal in order to remove artifacts that might have occurred during acquisition or to enhance the signal to noise ratio. These include slice-timing correction, motion correction, spatial normalization and spatial smoothing.


% \section{Hemodynamic response function (HRF)}\label{subsec:hrf}
% \newglossaryentry{HRF}{name=HRF,description=Hemodynamic Response Function}

% One of the difficulties associated with fMRI studies is that BOLD signal does not increase instantaneously after the stimulus presentation nor does it return to baseline immediately after the stimulus ends. Instead, the BOLD signal peaks approximately 5 seconds after stimulation, and is followed by an undershoot that lasts as long as 30 seconds.

% The \emph{Hemodynamic Response Function} (\gls{HRF}) represents an ideal, noiseless response to an infinitesimally brief stimulus. Most software packages represent the HRF as a sum of two gamma probability density functions, where the first gamma probability density function models the shape of the initial stimulus response and the second gamma probability density functions models the undershoot. Its analytical form is
% \begin{equation}
% h(t) = \frac{t^{\alpha_1 - 1} \beta_1^{\alpha_1} e^{-\beta_1 t}}{\Gamma(\alpha_1)} - 
% c \frac{t^{\alpha_2 - 1} \beta_2^{\alpha_2} e^{-\beta_2 t}}{\Gamma(\alpha_2)}
% \end{equation}
% where $\Gamma$ is the gamma function and $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \beta_1, \beta_2$ control the shape and scale, respectively, and $c$ determines the ratio of the response to undershoot.

% \begin{figure}
% \includegraphics[width=1.\linewidth]{figures/chapter_1/canonical_hrf.pdf}
% \hspace{-20pt}\caption{Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF) as implemented in different software packages. AFNI provides an HRF with no undershoot, i.e. modeled as a single gamma probability density function and where the peak is situated at 4.6 seconds. The software SPM provides an HRF that peaks at 5 seconds. \citet{Glover1999} proposes two models of the HRF, one based on a motor task and another based on an auditory task. Here we show the HRF corresponding to the auditory task since this is the one that is used in the software NiPy.}\label{fig:hrf_models}
% \end{figure}

% \newglossaryentry{reference HRF}{name=reference HRF,description=A particular HRF used in a software package.}



% All the packages that we have considered model the HRF as the different of two gamma probability density functions but other models are equally possible. For instance, ~\citep{lindquist2009modeling} proposes the use of a model based on the superposition of three inverse logit functions.


% \citet*{Glover1999} proposed two different sets of parameters based on the shape of the HRF on two different experiments. The parameters that are commonly used in statistical software such as \href{http://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/fmristat/}{FMRISTAT}\footnote{\href{http://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/fmristat/}{http://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/fmristat/}} and \href{http://nipy.org}{NIPY}\footnote{\href{http://nipy.org}{http://nipy.org}} correspond to the HRF estimated in the auditory task. Its first gamma function peaks at 5.2 seconds, while the second gamma function (the undershoot) peaks at 12.2 seconds and has an amplitude of 35\% of the first gamma function. 

% % This model has widely been shown to be successful at detecting fMRI activations and has been used extensively {\blue CITATION NEEDED}.


% In the SPM\footnote{\href{http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/}{http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/}} software, the reference HRF has its peak at 6 seconds and the delay of undershoot has its minima at 16 seconds. AFNI\footnote{\href{http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/}{http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/} } on the other hands uses $c = 0$, that is, uses a model with a single gamma  distribution. A comparison of these different HRF models can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:hrf_models}. Because of its widespread use, we will use the HRF present in SPM 8 unless otherwise specified.

% \section{The linear-time-invariant assumption}\label{subsec:lti}

% \newglossaryentry{LTI}{name=LTI,description=Linear Time Invariant assumption}

% In this section we present the main assumption behind the general linear model, the \emph{linear time invariance} assumption.

% A number of studies
% have reported that in certain regimes the relationship between the neural response and the BOLD signal exhibits~\emph{linear time invariant} (\gls{LTI}) properties~\citep{Boynton1996,Cohen1997,Dale1997}. These property can be summarized as
% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\bf Multiplicative scaling}. If a neural response is scaled by a factor of $\alpha$, then the BOLD response is also scaled by a factor of $\alpha$.
% \item {\bf Additivity}. If the response to two separate events is known, the signal for those events if they were to occur close in time is the sum of the independent signals.
% \item {\bf Time invariant}. If the stimulus is shifted by $t$ seconds, the BOLD response will also be shifted by this same amount.
% \end{itemize}

% While the LTI assumption is commonplace in practice, there is evidence for non-linearity in the amplitude of the BOLD response. For example, it is known that there is a saturation effect for stimuli that occur less than 2 seconds apart~\citep{Wager2005206}. It has also been reported that very brief stimuli exhibit a larger BOLD response than would be expected based on longer stimuli~\citep{Yesilyurt2008853}. However, while these nonlinearities are important, there is a general consensus that for the range in which most cognitive fMRI studies occur, they will have relatively small impact.

% \begin{figure}
% \centering \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{figures/chapter_1/linear_hrf.pdf}
% \caption{The linear time invariant (LTI) assumption implies that if the response to two separate events is known, the signal for those events if they were to occur close in time is the sum of the independent signals.

% \newglossaryentry{GLM}{name={GLM},description={General Linear Model}}



% Let $x(t)$ represent the predicted BOLD arising from neuronal activity as a function of time $t$ and $h(\tau)$ be some reference HRF. The LTI assumption allows to easily construct the predicted BOLD response for a given stimulus function $u(t)$ which encodes the presence or absence of a stimulus (defined as one whenever the stimulus is present and zero otherwise). Then we can express the predicted BOLD (up to a constant factor) as the convolution of the stimulus function $u(t)$ with the HRF:
% \begin{equation}
% x(t) = \int_{0}^T\!u(t - \tau) h(\tau) \mathrm{d}\tau
% \label{eq:chap1_predicted_bold}
% \end{equation}

% \section{The general linear model (GLM)}\label{chapter_1_GLM}


% The General Linear Model (\gls{GLM}) makes use of the knowledge of the hemodynamic response function and linear-time-invariant assumption to model the observed BOLD signal. This model states that the BOLD signal can be expressed in terms of a linear combination of the predicted fMRI responses for different stimuli (also denoted \gls{conditions}) plus a noise term. Let $\{x_1(t), x_2(t), \ldots, x_k(t)\}$ be the predicted response for $k$ different stimulus functions computed from Equation~\eqref{eq:chap1_predicted_bold}. We define the design matrix $\B{X}$ as the columnwise stacking of different regressors, each one defined as the discretization of $x_i(t)$ to match the acquisition time of a given BOLD signal. The GLM in its basic form can be expressed as:
% \begin{equation}
% \begin{aligned}
% \B{y} = \B{X}\bfbeta + \bvarepsilon \\
% \bvarepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 \B{I})
% \end{aligned}
% \label{eq:chapter_1_glm}
% \end{equation}
% where $\B{y} \in \RR^n$ is the observed time course at a single voxel, $\bfbeta \in \RR^k$ is the activation coefficients that represent the amplitude of the response for a given condition and $\bfvarepsilon$ is a noise term that we assume Gaussian for now (we will see in Section~\ref{subsec:prewhite} how to take into account temporal autocorrelation). 
% \begin{figure*}[t]
% \center \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{figures/chapter_1/glm_plain.pdf}
% \caption{The GLM expresses the observed BOLD signal as a linear combination of regressors plus an error term. Each regressor of the design matrix is the convolution of a reference HRF and the stimulus function, a function that is 1 when the stimulus is present and zero otherwise. Each element of the (unknown) activation coefficients represent the relative amplitude of a given condition.}\label{fig:glm1}
% \end{figure*}


% Assuming Gaussian i.i.d noise, the maximum likelihood estimation of the activation coefficients is then given by $\hat{\bfbeta} = \argmin_{\bfbeta}\|\B{y} - \B{X}\bfbeta \|^2 = \B{X}^{\dagger} \B{y}$. To estimate the activation coefficients in a full brain volume this procedure is repeated independently for each voxel. Since the design matrix is the same across voxels, a matrix decomposition of $\B{X}$ such as SVD or QR can be computed once and then used to compute the least squares solution at every voxel.


% In this setting we have considered the HRF to be known and fixed across the different conditions. We can easily generalize this setting to accommodate the case in which the HRF is generated by a given basis set. We will call this method \emph{basis-constrained GLM}.


% \section{High-pass filtering and prewhitening}\label{subsec:prewhite}

% The BOLD signal contains low frequency trends that are usually removed before or during the estimation of activation coefficients. One popular approach of high-pass filtering is to add a discrete cosine transform (DCT) basis set to the design matrix. When using this basis set, the highest frequency that is desired to be removed from the data has to be chosen to avoid removing the frequency of the experimental task that is also being modeled. Another approach that is becoming increasingly popular, is to fit a local regression model to the time series and remove the estimated trend from the data. The software FSL uses LOWESS (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing)~\citep{cleveland1979robust} while recent studies have successfully used a Savizky-Golay filter
% \sidenote{Savitzky-Golay filter are available in Matlab under the name \texttt{\small sgolayfilt} and in Python's Scipy module under the name \texttt{\small scipy.signal.savgol\_filter}}
% \citep{barry2014enhanced,ccukur2013attention}. In the studies presented in Chapter 3 we will use this last filter.  In \citep{ccukur2013attention}, the authors used a Savizky-Golay filter to estimate the low-frequency drifts with window length of 240 seconds and polynomial of degree 3. We have found that parameters close to these work well in practice. 
% \newglossaryentry{AR(1)}{name={AR(1)},description={autorregressive with variance 1}}


% The GLM specified in~\eqref{eq:chapter_1_glm} assumes the noise $\bvarepsilon$ follows a Gaussian random variable with covariance $\sigma^2 \B{I}$. However, it is known that the BOLD signal is temporally autocorrelated. Several authors~\citep{bullmore1996statistical,kruggel2000nonlinear} consider the BOLD noise as an autoregressive model \emph{AR(1)}. This assumes each time point is correlated with the previous time point. The distribution of the error in this case is given by $\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 \B{V})$, where $\B{V}$ is the symmetric correlation matrix and $\sigma^2$ is the variance. The correlation matrix and variance are commonly estimated from the residuals after fitting the GLM. 

% The most common solution to take this special structure into account is to \emph{prewhiten} the data, that is, to remove the temporal correlation. Since the correlation matrix $\B{V}$ is symmetric and positive definite, the Cholesky decomposition can be used to find a matrix $\B{K}$ such that $\B{V}^{-1} = \B{K}^T \B{K}$. To prewhiten the data, $\B{K}$ is premultiplied on both sides of the GLM (Eq.~\eqref{eq:chapter_1_glm}) to give $\B{K}\B{y} = \B{K}\B{X} \bfbeta + \B{K}\bfvarepsilon$. This makes the errors be independent, i.e., $\B{K}\bfvarepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 \B{I})$.
