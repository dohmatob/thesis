@Article{	  chaari2012,
  abstract	= {Identifying brain hemodynamics in event-related functional
		  MRI (fMRI) data is a crucial issue to disentangle the
		  vascular response from the neuronal activity in the BOLD
		  signal. This question is usually addressed by estimating
		  the so-called hemodynamic response function (HRF).
		  Voxelwise or region-/parcelwise inference schemes have been
		  proposed to achieve this goal but so far all known
		  contributions commit to pre-specified spatial supports for
		  the hemodynamic territories by defining these supports
		  either as individual voxels or a priori fixed brain
		  parcels. In this paper, we introduce a joint
		  parcellation-detection-estimation (JPDE) procedure that
		  incorporates an adaptive parcel identification step based
		  upon local hemodynamic properties. Efficient inference of
		  both evoked activity, HRF shapes and supports is then
		  achieved using variational approximations. Validation on
		  synthetic and real fMRI data demonstrate the JPDE
		  performance over standard detection estimation schemes and
		  suggest it as a new brain exploration tool.},

@Article{	  doyle2013,
  abstract	= {Neuroimaging data are increasingly being used to predict
		  potential outcomes or groupings, such as clinical severity,
		  drug dose response, and transitional illness states. In
		  these examples, the variable (target) we want to predict is
		  ordinal in nature. Conventional classification schemes
		  assume that the targets are nominal and hence ignore their
		  ranked nature, whereas parametric and/or non-parametric
		  regression models enforce a metric notion of distance
		  between classes. Here, we propose a novel, alternative
		  multivariate approach that overcomes these limitations -
		  whole brain probabilistic ordinal regression using a
		  Gaussian process framework. We applied this technique to
		  two data sets of pharmacological neuroimaging data from
		  healthy volunteers. The first study was designed to
		  investigate the effect of ketamine on brain activity and
		  its subsequent modulation with two compounds - lamotrigine
		  and risperidone. The second study investigates the effect
		  of scopolamine on cerebral blood flow and its modulation
		  using donepezil. We compared ordinal regression to
		  multi-class classification schemes and metric regression.
		  Considering the modulation of ketamine with lamotrigine, we
		  found that ordinal regression significantly outperformed
		  multi-class classification and metric regression in terms
		  of accuracy and mean absolute error. However, for
		  risperidone ordinal regression significantly outperformed
		  metric regression but performed similarly to multi-class
		  classification both in terms of accuracy and mean absolute
		  error. For the scopolamine data set, ordinal regression was
		  found to outperform both multi-class and metric regression
		  techniques considering the regional cerebral blood flow in
		  the anterior cingulate cortex. Ordinal regression was thus
		  the only method that performed well in all cases. Our
		  results indicate the potential of an ordinal regression
		  approach for neuroimaging data while providing a fully
		  probabilistic framework with elegant approaches for model
		  selection.},

  abstract	= "This paper reviews hierarchical observation models, used
		  in functional neuroimaging, in a Bayesian light. It
		  emphasizes the common ground shared by classical and
		  Bayesian methods to show that conventional analyses of
		  neuroimaging data can be usefully extended within an
		  empirical Bayesian framework. In particular we formulate
		  the procedures used in conventional data analysis in terms
		  of hierarchical linear models and establish a connection
		  between classical inference and parametric empirical Bayes
		  (PEB) through covariance component estimation. This
		  estimation is based on an expectation maximization or
		  \{EM\} algorithm. The key point is that hierarchical models
		  not only provide for appropriate inference at the highest
		  level but that one can revisit lower levels suitably
		  equipped to make Bayesian inferences. Bayesian inferences
		  eschew many of the difficulties encountered with classical
		  inference and characterize brain responses in a way that is
		  more directly predicated on what one is interested in. The
		  motivation for Bayesian approaches is reviewed and the
		  theoretical background is presented in a way that relates
		  to conventional methods, in particular restricted maximum
		  likelihood (ReML). This paper is a technical and
		  theoretical prelude to subsequent papers that deal with
		  applications of the theory to a range of important issues
		  in neuroimaging. These issues include; (i) Estimating
		  nonsphericity or variance components in fMRI time-series
		  that can arise from serial correlations within subject, or
		  are induced by multisubject (i.e., hierarchical) studies.
		  (ii) Spatiotemporal Bayesian models for imaging data, in
		  which voxels-specific effects are constrained by responses
		  in other voxels. (iii) Bayesian estimation of nonlinear
		  models of hemodynamic responses and (iv) principled ways of
		  mixing structural and functional priors in \{EEG\} source
		  reconstruction. Although diverse, all these estimation
		  problems are accommodated by the \{PEB\} framework
		  described in this paper. "

  abstract	= {{Decoding, i.e. predicting stimulus related quantities
		  from functional brain images, is a powerful tool to
		  demonstrate differences between brain activity across
		  conditions. However, unlike standard brain mapping, it
		  offers no guaranties on the localization of this
		  information. Here, we consider decoding as a statistical
		  estimation problem and show that injecting a spatial
		  segmentation prior leads to unmatched performance in
		  recovering predictive regions. Specifically, we use L1
		  penalization to set voxels to zero and Total-Variation (TV)
		  penalization to segment regions. Our contribution is
		  two-fold. On the one hand, we show via extensive
		  experiments that, amongst a large selection of decoding and
		  brain-mapping strategies, TV+L1 leads to best region
		  recovery. On the other hand, we consider implementation
		  issues related to this estimator. To tackle efficiently
		  this joint prediction-segmentation problem we introduce a
		  fast optimization algorithm based on a primal-dual
		  approach. We also tackle automatic setting of
		  hyper-parameters and fast computation of image operation on
		  the irregular masks that arise in brain imaging.}},

  abstract	= {In Penny et al. [Penny, W., Ghahramani, Z., Friston, K.J.
		  2005. Bilinear dynamical systems. Philos. Trans. R. Soc.
		  Lond. B Biol. Sci. 360(1457) 983-993], a particular case of
		  the Linear Dynamical Systems (LDSs) was used to model the
		  dynamic behavior of the BOLD response in functional MRI.
		  This state-space model, called bilinear dynamical system
		  (BDS), is used to deconvolve the fMRI time series in order
		  to estimate the neuronal response induced by the different
		  stimuli of the experimental paradigm. The BDS model
		  parameters are estimated using an expectation-maximization
		  (EM) algorithm proposed by Ghahramani and Hinton
		  [Ghahramani, Z., Hinton, G.E. 1996. Parameter Estimation
		  for Linear Dynamical Systems. Technical Report, Department
		  of Computer Science, University of Toronto]. In this paper
		  we introduce modifications to the BDS model in order to
		  explicitly model the spatial variations of the haemodynamic
		  response function (HRF) in the brain using a non-parametric
		  approach. While in Penny et al. [Penny, W., Ghahramani, Z.,
		  Friston, K.J. 2005. Bilinear dynamical systems. Philos.
		  Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 360(1457) 983-993] the
		  relationship between neuronal activation and fMRI signals
		  is formulated as a first-order convolution with a kernel
		  expansion using basis functions (typically two or three),
		  in this paper, we argue in favor of a spatially adaptive
		  GLM in which a local non-parametric estimation of the HRF
		  is performed. Furthermore, in order to overcome the
		  overfitting problem typically associated with simple EM
		  estimates, we propose a full Variational Bayes (VB)
		  solution to infer the BDS model parameters. We demonstrate
		  the usefulness of our model which is able to estimate both
		  the neuronal activity and the haemodynamic response
		  function in every voxel of the brain. We first examine the
		  behavior of this approach when applied to simulated data
		  with different temporal and noise features. As an example
		  we will show how this method can be used to improve
		  interpretability of estimates from an independent component
		  analysis (ICA) analysis of fMRI data. We finally
		  demonstrate its use on real fMRI data in one slice of the
		  brain.},

  abstract	= {Recently, pattern recognition methods (e.g., support
		  vector machines (SVM)) have been used to analyze fMRI data.
		  In these applications the fMRI scans are treated as spatial
		  patterns and statistical learning methods are used to
		  identify statistical properties of the data that
		  discriminate between brain states (e.g., task 1 vs. task 2)
		  or group of subjects (e.g., patients and controls). We
		  propose an extension of these approaches using temporal
		  embedding. This makes the dynamic aspect of fMRI time
		  series an explicit part of the classification. The proposed
		  pattern recognition approach uses both spatial and temporal
		  information. Temporal embedding was implemented by defining
		  spatiotemporal fMRI observations and applying a support
		  vector machine to these temporally extended observations.
		  This produces a discriminating weight vector encompassing
		  both voxels and time. The resulting vector furnishes
		  discriminating responses, at each voxel without imposing
		  any constraints on their temporal form.},
